# Shopify Gumroad Products Repository

This repository is the internal hub for all Shopify‑related digital products we sell on Gumroad. It contains:

- **Product folders** (`products/<product-name>/`) with sections, assets, templates, docs, marketing assets, preview images, and release zips.
- **Shared assets** (`shared/`) that can be reused across multiple products (CSS, JS, snippets, fonts, colors, etc.).
- **Tools** (`tools/`) for building Gumroad‑ready zip files and verifying theme integrity.

## How to Add a New Product
1. **Copy the template folder** `products/dawn-sections-pack-beauty/` to a new folder under `products/`.
2. Fill in the `sections/`, `assets/`, `templates/`, `docs/`, `marketing/`, and `previews/` directories.
3. Run `tools/build-zip.sh <product-folder>` to generate a Gumroad‑ready zip in `releases/`.
4. Tag the release with `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"` and push tags.

## Build & Verification Scripts
- **build-zip.sh** – Packages a product folder into a clean zip, excluding temporary files.
- **verify-theme.sh** – Checks that all required files exist (sections, JSON layout, docs, etc.).

## Version Control
All changes are committed with conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new sections or features.
- `docs:` for documentation updates.
- `chore:` for build scripts or config changes.
